# PatternFly 5 HTML/CSS Code Guidelines

Please enforce these guidelines at all times. Small or large, call out what's incorrect.

> Every line of code should appear to be written by a single person, no matter the number of contributors.

This set of rules generate some constraints and conventions. If you ran into instances where a convention isn’t obvious or a solution could be handled in a few different ways, contact the PatternFly community, have a conversation about how to handle it and update this guidelines when needed.

# HTML

**Practicality over purity**. Strive to maintain HTML standards and semantics, but not at the expense of practicality. Use the least amount of markup with the fewest intricacies whenever possible.

<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Syntax

- Use soft tabs with two spaces.
- Nested elements should be indented once (two spaces).
- Always use double quotes, never single quotes, on attributes.
- Don’t include a trailing slash in self-closing elements.
- Don’t omit optional closing tags (e.g. </li> or </body>).
- Don't add a value to a boolean attribute e.g., `<input type="text" disabled>`.
- Lowercase tag name.
- Lowercase attribute name.
- Use HTML5 elements where appropriate, e.g., `article`, `aside`, `figure`, `figcaption`, `header`, `footer`, `main`, `nav`, `section`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="images/company-logo.png" alt="Company">
    <h1 class="hello-world">Hello, world!</h1>
    <input type="text" disabled>
  </body>
</html>
```

<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Attribute order

HTML attributes should come in this particular order for easier reading of code.

- `class`
- `id`, `name`
- `data-*`
- `src`, `for`, `type`, `href`, `value`
- `title`, `alt`
- `role`, `aria-*`


```html
<a class="..." id="..." data-toggle="modal" href="#">
  Example link
</a>

<input class="form-control" type="text">

<img src="..." alt="...">
```

<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Reducing markup

Whenever possible, avoid superfluous parent elements when writing HTML. Take the following example:

```html
<!-- Not so good -->
<span class="avatar">
  <img src="...">
</span>

<!-- Better -->
<img class="avatar" src="...">
```

<!-- ============================================================ -->

# CSS

Before we discuss how we write out our rulesets, let’s first familiarise ourselves with relevant terminology:

```
[selector] {
  [property]: [value];
  [<--declaration--->]
}
[<------rule-------->]
```

For example:

```sass
.foo {
  display: block;
}
```

<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Syntax

- Use soft tabs with two spaces.
- When grouping selectors, keep individual selectors to a single line.
- Include one space before the opening brace of declaration blocks for legibility.
- Include a blank line between rules.
- Place closing braces of declaration blocks on a new line.
- Include one space after `:` for each declaration.
- Each declaration should appear on its own line for more accurate error reporting.
- End all declarations with a semi-colon, even the last one.
- Comma-separated property values should include a space after each comma (e.g., `box-shadow`).
- Don't include spaces after commas within `rgb()`, `rgba()`, `hsl()`, `hsla()`, or `rect()` values. This helps differentiate multiple color values (comma, no space) from multiple property values (comma with space).
- Lowercase all hex values, e.g., `#fff`.
- Use shorthand hex values where available, e.g., `#fff` instead of `#ffffff`.
- Quote attribute values in selectors, e.g., `input[type="text"]`.
- Don't prefix property values or color parameters with a leading zero (e.g., `.5` instead of `0.5` and `-.5em` instead of `-0.5em`).
- Avoid specifying units for zero values, e.g., `margin: 0;` instead of `margin: 0px;`.


```sass
// Bad
.selector, .selector-secondary, .selector[type=text] {
  padding:15px;
  margin:0px 0px 15px;
  background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  box-shadow:0px 1px 2px #CCC,inset 0 1px 0 #FFFFFF
}

// Good
.selector,
.selector_element,
.selector[type="text"] {
  padding: 15px;
  margin-bottom: 15px;
  background-color: rgba(0,0,0,.5);
  box-shadow: 0 1px 2px #ccc, inset 0 1px 0 #fff;
}
```

<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Writing selectors

- Every element has a class, never use type selectors.
- Bring selector as close to the element as possible (see [BEM](#bem)).
- Every element has a single, unique, component-scoped source of truth.
- Only bind CSS onto CSS-based classes.
- Don't write DOM-like selector.

```sass
// Bad
.selector ul li {
  ...
}

// Good
.selector_item {
  ...
}
```

### Single Responsibility Principle

Each selector has a single responsability. They are be granular, modular, flexible and they do one thing, one thing only and do that thing very well.

```sass
// Bad
.component-login {
  display: inline-block; // base
  padding: 2em; // structural
  background-color: green; //cosmentic
  color: white; //cosmentic
}

// Good
.pf-component {
  display: inline-block;
}

.pf-component--large {
  padding: 2em;
}

.pf-component--positive {
  background-color: green;
  color: white;
}
```
<!--
Selectors fall into 3 categories:

- Components
- Layouts
- Utilities

#### Layout

Layout are containers concern about it's children vertical and horizontal alignment and spacing.


#### Components

Components are modular and independent structures concern about how a thing looks.

- A component always touches all four sides of its parent container. No element will have top or left margins and all last children (right or bottom) will have their margins cleared.
- The component itself never has widths or floats.
- Elements inside a component never use top margins. The first element touches the top of its component.


#### Utilities

Utility classes have the single purpose to reduce the frequency of highly repetitive declarations.

-->

<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Modifications and extension

Keep maintainability in mind, it's better to create a new single purpose components than extending an existing one.

### PatternFly is open for extension, close for modifications

Since PatternFly is a dependency, always write CSS open for extension and close for modifications.

This will protect our users from undesired regressions, conflicts and collisions.

- Don't change anything unless its a bug, only go back to fix errors.
- Don't do mutations: always avoid context selectors.

### When to create a new component?

As a general rule create extension to an element with BEM modifiers if it’s a change of color or scale, if the change generates a new entity, then create a new component.

Repetition is better than the wrong abstraction.

<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Declaration order

Related property declarations should be grouped together following a logical order:

1. Positioning
1. Box model
1. Typographic
1. Visual

Positioning comes first because it can remove an element from the normal flow of the document and override box model related styles. The box model comes next as it dictates a component's dimensions and placement.

Everything else takes place inside the component or without impacting the previous two sections, and thus they come last.

For a complete list of properties and their order, please see [Field CSS Manuals]( http://manuals.gravitydept.com/code/css/properties).

```sass
.declaration-order {
  // Positioning
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  z-index: 100;

  // Box-model
  display: block;
  float: right;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;

  // Typography
  font: normal 13px "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.5;
  color: #333;
  text-align: center;

  // Visual
  background-color: #f5f5f5;
  border: 1px solid #e5e5e5;
  border-radius: 3px;

  // Misc
  opacity: 1;
}
```

<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Prefixed properties

PatternFly uses [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to deal with CSS vendor prefixes.

**Do not add vendor prefixes**

```sass
// Bad
.selector {
  -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px $color;
          box-shadow: 0 1px 2px $color;
}

// Good
.selector {
  box-shadow: 0 1px 2px $color;
}
```

<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Single declarations

To improve error detection in instances where a rule set includes only one declaration, remove line breaks for readability and faster editing. Any rule set with multiple declarations should be split to separate lines.

```sass
// Single declarations on one line
.span1 { width: 60px; }
.span2 { width: 140px; }
.span3 { width: 220px; }

// Multiple declarations, one per line
.sprite {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 16px;
  height: 15px;
  background-image: url(../img/sprite.png);
}

.icon            { background-position: 0 0; }
.icon--home      { background-position: 0 -20px; }
.icon--account   { background-position: 0 -40px; }
```

<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Shorthand notation

Limit the use of shorthand declarations to instances where you must explicitly set all the available values. Common overused shorthand properties include:

- `padding`
- `margin`
- `font`
- `background`
- `border`
- `border-radius`

```sass
// Bad
.element {
  margin: 0 0 10px;
  background: red;
  background: url("image.jpg");
  border-radius: 3px 3px 0 0;
}

// Good
.element {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  background-color: red;
  background-image: url("image.jpg");
  border-top-left-radius: 3px;
  border-top-right-radius: 3px;
}
```

The Mozilla Developer Network has a great article on [shorthand properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties) for those unfamiliar with notation and behaviour. And also [Harry Robert's](https://csswizardry.com/2016/12/css-shorthand-syntax-considered-an-anti-pattern/) article.

<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Comment and Organization

Code is written and maintained by people. Ensure your code is descriptive, well commented, and approachable by others. Great code comments convey context or purpose. Do not simply reiterate a component or class name.

Be sure to write in complete sentences for larger comments and succinct phrases for general notes.

Follow this comment structure:

1. License header
1. Doc Block
1. Sections
1. Line

```

### 1. License header

PatternFly is license under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

- Always add the Apache v2.0 license header at the top of each scss files.
- Leave three blank lines bellow.

### 2. Doc Block

- Includes the name of the component and an optional comment.
- Leave three blank lines bellow.

### 3. Section

The Section comment is a section divider or describes a block of code.

- Leave one blank lines above.

### 4. Line

Describes a specific line of code.


<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Naming Selectors

Naming is hard.

Create names with useful or specific meaning via a mechanism that will not inhibit your and your team’s ability to recycle and reuse CSS.

- Keep classes lowercase.
- Use dashes to separate words (not underscores or camelCase).
- Avoid excessive and arbitrary shorthand notation, e.g., `.btn` is useful for button, but `.s` doesn't mean anything.
- Keep classes as short and succinct as possible.
- Use meaningful names, use structural or purposeful names over presentational.
- Apply these same rules when creating Sass variable names.

```sass
// Bad
.t { ... }
.red { ... }
.header { ... }

// Good
.tweet { ... }
.card { ... }
.twee_header { ... }
```

### BEM

PatternFly follows the [BEM methodology](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/). It's a way to decouple CSS from HTML, and modularise class names so they can be extended.

Class name structure follows the `{{pf-block}}_{{element}}--{{modifier}}` structure:

```sass
.pf-block_element--modifier {}
```

Example:

```html
<div class="pf-panel pf-panel--collapsible">
  <div class="pf-panel_title">
    <h1>Heading</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="pf-panel_content">
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

```sass
.pf-panel {}                      // Block
.pf-panel--collapsible {}         // Modifier of block

.pf-panel_title {}               // Element

.pf-panel_content {}             // Element
.pf-panel_content--unpadded {}   // Modifier of element
```

Why it’s better:

- All the selectors have same specificity.
- Every element is defined via a block.
- Every modifier is defined via a block or element.
- Each class name imparts structural info without binding to exact HTML.


### Namespace

To avoid conflicts PatternFly prefixes all classes with “pf-”. This also helps differentiates PatternFly and Bootstrap class names.

```sass
// Bad
.selector {
  ...
}

// Good
.pf-selector {
  ...
}
```

<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Specificity

Always keep selectors as low as possible.

```sass
// Bad
.header .search-box input[type=search] + .button {}

.pf-search-box {
  .btn {}
}


// Good
.pf-search_button {}
```

### Nesting

Avoid Sass nesting, but if your really have to do it never go more than three layers deep.

Limit nesting to the following use cases:

1. Modifiers of a style block
1. Media queries
1. Context selectors
1. States, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements

Use the least number of selectors required to style an element. As a rule, if a selector will work without it being nested then do not nest it.

#### 1. Modifiers of a style block

Make use of [Sass’s parent selector](https://css-tricks.com/the-sass-ampersand/ mechanism to write BEM modifiers, but don't nest element selectors:

```sass
// Bad
.pf-nav {
  &_item {
    ...
  }
  &--modifier {
    ...
  }
}

// Good
.pf-nav {
  &--modifier {
    ...
  }
}
.pf-nav_item {
  ...
}
```
For longer style blocks don't nest the modifier as it reduced the legibility of the code.

#### 2. Media queries

Component-specific media queries should be nested inside the component block. Use [Bootstrap responsive breakpoints mixins](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/layout/overview/#responsive-breakpoints) and remember that PatternFly is mobile first.

**Do progressive enhancement, not gracefully degrade.**


```sass
.pf-nav {
  ...

  // Styles for small view ports and up
  @include media-breakpoint-up(sm) { ... }
}
```

#### 3. Context selectors

Context selectors should be avoided. If a component is different due to it's location, then you should consider creating a new component.

But if you must declare a context selector make use of [Sass’s parent selector](https://css-tricks.com/the-sass-ampersand/ mechanism. This allows all rules for a given component to be maintained in one location.

```sass
.pf-nav {
  .pf-header & {
    ...
  }
}
```

All styles for `.pf-nav` should be found in one place, rather than scattered throughout multiple partial files.

#### 4. States, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements

States of a component should be included as a nested element. This includes hover, focus, and active states:

```sass
.btn {
    background: $color;

    &:hover, &:focus {
        background: $lighter-color;
    }
}
```

### !important

Never use `!important` to raise the specificity of a rule.

Use `!important` for utility classes.

```sass
// Bad
.some-form {
  color: $color !important;
}
```

<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Bootstrap

Keep PatternFly styles independent from Bootstrap.

When writing a PatternFly component don't extend or build on top of Bootstrap structure.

**To style Bootstrap components:**

- Start by overwriting Bootstraps variables on `pf-variables.scss`
- If it needs further modifications, then create a `pf-component.scss` and base your styles on the original bootstrap scss file.
- Be precise and accurate, introduce as little modifications as possible to achieve the design.
- Bootstrap uses a modified version of BEM: `{{block}}-{{element}}-{{modifier}}`.

```sass
// Overwrite Bootstrap card block
.card {
  border: none;
}

// Overwrite Bootstrap card header element
.card-header{
  background: $pf-card-cap-bg;
  border-bottom-color: $pf-card-border-color;
}

// Overwrite Bootstrap card footer element
.card-footer{
  background: $pf-card-footer-bg;
  border-top-color: $pf-card-border-color
}

// Introduces PatternFly card modifier
.pf-card--accented {
  border-top: 2px solid $pf-color-blue-300;
}    
```
<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Typography

HTML elements are never referenced in the stylesheets, only classes are used for selection.

Don't add styles to a paragraph or heading tags.

Every typography element has a zero margin and base font-size. Margins and font treatments are added width classes.

```html
<h1 class="pf-h1">Heading</h1>
```

A user can opt-in typography vertical rythm by using `.pf-vertical-rythm` class to it's container.

<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Spaces

Always use PatternFly spacing variables to define `margin` and `padding`

```sass
$pf-spacer-xxxs   // ~3px
$pf-spacer-xxs    // 7px
$pf-spacer-xs     // ~10px
$pf-spacer-sm     // 14px
$pf-spacer-md     // ~17px
$pf-spacer-lg     // 21px
$pf-spacer-xl     // ~24px
$pf-spacer-xxl    // 28 px
$pf-spacer-xxxl   // 35 px
$pf-spacer-xxxxl  // 42 px
```

```sass
.nav-link {
  padding-bottom: $pf-spacer-xxxs;
}

.dropdown-menu {
  margin-left: $pf-spacer-sm;
}
```

You can also use [Bootstrap spacing utilities](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/utilities/spacing/) with PatternFly sizes:

```html
<p class="mb-lg">This paragraph has a large bottom margin</p>
```

### Comment all magic numbers

If a situation arises where a pixel based value needs entering into the authoring style sheets that isn't already defined in the variables this should serve as a red flag to you.

In the case where a 'magic' number needs entering in the authoring style sheets, ensure a comment is added on the line above to explain its relevance.


<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Shadows

PatternFly has 6 types of shadows, always variables to apply `box-shadow`:

```sass
$pf-box-shadow-sm
$pf-box-shadow-md
$pf-box-shadow-lg
$pf-box-shadow-inset
$pf-box-shadow-left
$pf-box-shadow-right
```

```sass
.btn {
  box-shadow: $pf-box-shadow-sm;
}
```

You can also use box shadow utilities to add or remove shadows to any element:

```html
<p class="pf-box-shadow-md">This paragraph has a medium box shadow</p>

<button class="btn btn-primary pf-box-shadow-none">This button has no shadow</button>
```

<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Gradients
PatternFly has one slight gradient to define panel headers, table headers, secondary btns and other elements. Always use the PatternFly gradient mixin to define it.

```sass
thead th {
  @include pf-gradient;
}
```

<!-- ============================================================ -->


## Sass

PatternFly uses [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) to preprocess CSS.

We limit our use of Sass to:

- variables
- mixins
- color functions
- math functions
- nesting

Please don't use loops or conditional statements unless absolutely necessary.

### Operators in Sass

For improved readability, wrap all math operations in parentheses with a single space between values, variables, and operators.

```sass
// Bad
.element {
  margin: 10px 0 @variable*2 10px;
}

// Good
.element {
  margin: 10px 0 (@variable * 2) 10px;
}
```

### Variables

A new variable should be created only when all of the following criteria are met:

- the value is repeated at least twice
- the value is likely to be updated at least once
- all occurrences of the value are tied to the variable (i.e. not by coincidence).
- variable format should follow the `$component-modifier-state-property` order.

There is no point declaring a variable that will never be updated or that is only being used at a single place.

**Don't reinvent the wheel:** Always use variables for spaces, colors, shadows and typography treatment.


### Mixins

The rule of thumb is that if you happen to spot a group of CSS properties that always appear together for a reason (i.e. not a coincidence), you can put them in a mixin instead.

Another valid example would be a mixin to size an element, defining both width and height at the same time. Not only would it make the code lighter to type, but also easier to read.

The keyword for using mixins is **simplicity**:

- Don't over-engineer
- Don’t over think your code
- above all keep it simple.

If a mixin ends up being longer than 20 lines or so, then it should be either split into smaller chunks or completely revised.


```sass
// Helper to size an element
// @param {Length} $width
// @param {Length} $height

@mixin size($width, $height: $width) {
  width: $width;
  height: $height;
}
```

### @extend

Treat @extend with resect. Use @extend only for maintaining relationships within selectors. If two selectors are characteristically similar, that is the perfect use-case for @extend. If they are unrelated but share some rules, a @mixin might suit you better.


- Stick to extending placeholders, not existing CSS selectors. Use extend on %placeholders primarily, not on actual selectors.
- Extend a placeholder as few times as possible in order to avoid side effects.
- When extending classes, only extend a class with another class, never a complex selector.
- Directly extend a %placeholder as few times as possible.
- Avoid extending general ancestor selectors (e.g. .foo .bar) or general sibling selectors (e.g. .foo ~ .bar). This is what causes selector explosion.

```sass
%button {
  display: inline-block;
  // … button styles

  // Relationship: a %button that is a child of a %modal
  %modal > & {
    display: block;
  }
}

.button {
  @extend %button;
}

// Good
.modal {
  @extend %modal;
}

// Bad
.modal {
  @extend %modal;

  > .button {
    @extend %button;
  }
}
```
