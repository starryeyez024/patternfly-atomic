title: PatternFly Secondary Navigation
---
## Overview

The secondary navigation can be used on it's own but it's usually used with primary horizontal nav or tabs.

## Accessibility
`role="tabpanel"` should be used for the div that wraps the tab contents.
- `aria-selected="true"` should be added to the anchor that is active.
- `aria-disabled="true"` should be added to the anchor that is disabled.
